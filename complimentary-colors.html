<!-- Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges.
    On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different
    combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color
    palette that works with your content. The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other -
    it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each
    other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined,
    they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more
    vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast


    Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an
    alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

    Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left,
    moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(),
    hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value
    between 0 and 360.

    Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color
    is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

    Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white),
    where 50% is the normal color. See Line * for Example

    The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint 
    of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting 
    and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent 
    changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when
    you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.-->
